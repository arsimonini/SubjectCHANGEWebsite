<blockquote class = "blogText">
    Hello survivors on the lower floors, We don't have much to update you on this week, but we want you to know that we are doing everything in our power to fully assess and understand the situation to get you out safely.

<blockquote class = "blogText">
    Over the week, we have doing our best to update the camera system we have here on the upper floors. With these new cameras we are hoping to be able to see finer details of the labs below. Though we have no full visuals yet (some finetuning is required) we believe with a little more time we will be able to see the textures of the lab equipment and general environment. We also strongly believe that we will have equipment some strong we will be able to even see the dust in the air, sparks from live wires, and even the laminated sparkle of key cards

    As for things we can say, we have some audio working on the camera system. Specifically, we can hear when objects are being thrown around. It is our hope that soon we will be able to hear softer sounds like footsteps as well as higher frequencies like Subject Echo and Radiant's screeching.

<blockquote class = "blogText">
    Finally, some updates on the Subjects. Through monitoring on the camera, we can see that the erratic unpredictable behavior and movement of the Subjects have shifted more to a calmer hunter approach. You can tell in the new way that they walk, idle in place, run, and even attack, they are clearly now more threatening in how they animate themselves. Added to that, the initial anger and confusion have worn off clearly as now they are more tuned in to their sense and can see their prey further away, using their bare hands as the main method of killing their target. We on the upper floors are tracking their movements and making new simulations so we can better understand them and come up with a way to get you out as pictured below.
