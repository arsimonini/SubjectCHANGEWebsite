<p style="font-size: 20px; color: white">Tuesday, April 8th, 2025: Mutations!</p>
<blockquote class = "blogText">
    Hello CREEP interns, it finally happened, we have exciting news about the mutations. Subject Radiant, Subject Echo, and Subject Change have all started to transform into their new forms.

    After weeks of toiling in CREEP HQ, the mutations have developed. Subject Echo's Bat like ears allow them to hear a water drop from miles away. It is important to note, that this mutation had a negative side effect of limiting Subject Echo's visibility. We've done extensive simulations as visualized below to test their capabilities in a field test. It seems that the lack of sight has made Subject Echo largely erratic, whenever he hears the slightest noise, he charges at the sound with murderous intent.

    Similarly, Subject Radiant has evolved to have the ability to sense and see even the faintest of light. However, it seems as a side effect, Subject Radiant becomes obsessed with the light trying to consume it's origin source. For the time being, Subject Radiant has been locked in a dark room until more simulations are completed.

    Finally, Subject Change has started her process of evolution developing a tail and beady eyes. We've started to run our simulations for what we expect Subject Change to be able to do.

    According to our simulations, we expect Subject Change to have the ability to blend into the background becoming nearly invisible to the naked eye. Added to that, through extensive tests we see that Subject Change will likely have a shift in personality, having an interest in collecting and interacting various objects. We're excited to see these changes fully in action on the real subject.

    Finally, for all of the CREEP industrialists reading these posts, you'd be happy to know that CREEP HQ is getting state of the art doors, ventilation and boiler room technology. The CREEP plumbers have just brought in the pipes and the CREEP electricians started to set up the doors. I'm sure it'll be soon we'll see them fully in action.
