<p style="font-size: 20px; color: white">Wednesday, March 26th, 2025: Moving Day and New Subjects</p>
<blockquote class = "blogText">
    Greetings CREEP interns and newcomers, welcome to the weekly update portion of this website. Here you can expect updates, interesting facts, and subject notes all on the ins and outs of CREEP HQ. As you may have heard in last week's memo. CREEP is moving buildings. Not much is known about this new location, but we have a general floor map, so we know what to expect.

    Added to this, progress has been going well on the mutation process for Subject: RADIANT and Subject: ECHO. Though right now, final mutations are only sketch work predictions, we have high hopes, that soon we'll be able to see some truly monstrous forms.

    Finally, as our subteams finalize in formation and starts to run more experiments, we have created a fully functional repository for our new files and test simulations. We even have an exciting simulation in development. A Subject that can change their very being to camouflage with it's environment. Though progress is only starting, we are excited for future experiments.
