<p style="font-size: 20px; color: white">Wednesday, April 30th, 2025: Final Update</p>
<blockquote class = "blogText">
    Hello survivors,
</blockquote>

<blockquote class = "blogText">
    I'm writing this as a final update to you, though I imagine there isn't many of you left. We have done everything to the best of our ability to get you home, but now, the Subjects have gotten too strong.

    Subject Echo and Subject Radiant now seemingly have complete control of their minds. They have hunted the remaining employees on the bottom level, only leaving a few. Echo seemingly has fully adapted, hearing it's target from further away and Radiant detects any source of light near them. They've even started to patrol the full area of the lab. Nowhere is safe...

<blockquote class = "blogText">
    We have updated our camera systems here as promised from last week. Now we can view the entire area in great details including the textures and materials of all of our lab equipment. The cameras are so finely tuned, in fact, we can even make out the smallest of details like the laminated gleam of the key cards or the sparks off of the broken lights. Added to that, we can now hear everything that goes on downstairs from the footsteps to the screeches of the Subjects.

We hope to all who have survived that you can somehow see the good that comes from this. With your contribution to the research on how these beings hunt, you are taking part in the future of science and life as a whole.

We thank you for your time working for us. Good luck, you'll need it.
